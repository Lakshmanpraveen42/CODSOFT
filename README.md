## Introduction
This repository showcases the machine learning projects I completed during my internship at CODSOFT. The tasks involve building models for various applications, including movie genre classification, credit card fraud detection, customer churn prediction, spam SMS detection, and handwritten text generation.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Movie Genre Classification
Create a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.

### Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.

### Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction
Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting.

### Task 4: Spam SMS Detection
Build an AI model that classifies SMS messages as spam or legitimate using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

### Task 5: Handwritten Text Generation
Implement a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate handwritten-like text based on a dataset of handwritten text examples.
